# XMProtect
http://www.xmprotect.com/

XMProtect is one of the best free obfuscation out there for your lib files, this is not for dex. This is one of the best free Chinese tools to use. All you have to do is sign up for free, then drag your lib files into it, protect it, then download it and it will work.

To know if it's obfuscated, check your lib in IDA Pro and compare your old one.

XMProtect Provides

# File modification prevention
Encrypt code and data, prevent file modification and
secondary packaging.

# Anti-debugger
Multiple anti-debugging schemes, anti-dynamic debugging,

# Logical confusion
Logic instructions are split out of order, which confuses the call flow.

# Symbol confusion
String, function symbol encryption processing
and dynamic decryption at runtime

# Virtualization protection
Original VM engine, core function virtualization protection

# Anti-API hook
Anti-code injection, anti-HOOK attack

# Claudiu Obfuscapk
What is Cladiu Obfuscapk? Cladiu is a person who created a Python APK Obfuscation dex files to protect against leechers. You need Python installed and it's requirements to get it fully working. 

An automatic obfuscation tool for Android apps that works in a black-box fashion, supports advanced obfuscation features and has a modular architecture easily extensible with new techniques.

Trivial:
 as the name suggests, this category includes simple operations (that do not modify much the original application), like signing the apk file with a new signature.

Rename:
 operations that change the names of the used identifiers (classes, fields, methods).

Encryption:
 packaging encrypted code/resources and decrypting them during the app execution. When Obfuscapk starts, it automatically generates a random secret key (32 characters long, using ASCII letters and digits) that will be used for encryption.

Code:
 all the operations that involve the modification of the decompiled source code.

Resources:
 operations on the resource files (like modifying the manifest).

I recommend using this obfuscation, as it has many features for this, probably better than most obfuscation.
